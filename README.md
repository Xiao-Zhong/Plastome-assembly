# Plastome-assembly
The pipeline can assemble a (near) complete plastome genome from short reads automatically. It condains both denovo and reference-based assembly, and is useful for large-scale chloroplast genome sequencing projects. For a single or few samples, please try NOVOPlasty, GetOrganelle or others.

The workflow is lack of maintenance nowadays.
